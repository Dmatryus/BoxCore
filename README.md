## Introduction

HypEx (Hypotheses and Experiments) is a comprehensive library crafted to streamline the causal inference and AB testing
processes in data analytics. Developed for efficiency and effectiveness, HypEx employs Rubin's Causal Model (RCM) for
matching closely related pairs, ensuring equitable group comparisons when estimating treatment effects.

Boasting a fully automated pipeline, HypEx adeptly calculates the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), Average Treatment
Effect on the Treated (ATT), and Average Treatment Effect on the Control (ATC). It offers a standardized interface for
executing these estimations, providing insights into the impact of interventions across various population subgroups.

Beyond causal inference, HypEx is equipped with robust AB testing tools, including Difference-in-Differences (
Diff-in-Diff) and CUPED methods, to rigorously test hypotheses and validate experimental results.

## Features

- **Faiss KNN Matching**: Utilizes Faiss for efficient and precise nearest neighbor searches, aligning with RCM for
  optimal pair matching.
- **Data Filters**: Built-in outlier and Spearman filters ensure data quality for matching.
- **Result Validation**: Offers multiple validation methods, including random treatment, feature, and subset
  validations.
- **Data Tests**: Incorporates SMD, KS, PSI, and Repeats tests to affirm the robustness of effect estimations.
- **Automated Feature Selection**: Employs LGBM feature selection to pinpoint the most impactful features for causal
  analysis.
- **AB Testing Suite**: Features a suite of AB testing tools for comprehensive hypothesis evaluation.
- **Stratification support**: Stratify groups for nuanced analysis
- **Weights support**:  Empower your analysis by assigning custom weights to features, enhancing the matching precision
  to suit your specific research needs

## Warnings

Some functions in HypEx can facilitate solving specific auxiliary tasks but cannot automate decisions on experiment
design. Below, we will discuss features that are implemented in HypEx but do not automate the design of experiments.

### Feature Selection

**Feature selection** models the significance of features for the accuracy of target approximation. However, it does not
rule out the possibility of overlooked features, the complex impact of features on target description, or the
significance of features from a business logic perspective. The algorithm will not function correctly if there are data
leaks.

Points to consider when selecting features:

* Data leaks - these should not be present.
* Influence on treatment distribution - features should not affect the treatment distribution.
* The target should be describable by features.
* All features significantly affecting the target should be included.
* The business rationale of features.
* The feature selection function can be useful for addressing these tasks, but it does not solve them nor does it
  absolve the user of the responsibility for their selection, nor does it justify it.

### Multitarget

**Multitarget** involves studying the impact on multiple targets.

The algorithm is implemented as a repetition of the same matching on the same feature space and samples, but with
different targets. To ensure the algorithm's correct operation, it's necessary to guarantee the independence of the
targets from each other.

The best solution would be to conduct several independent experiments, each with its own set of features for each
target.

### Random Treatment Ð¸ Random Feature

**Random Treatment** algorithm randomly shuffles the actual treatment. It is expected that the treatment's effect on the
target will be close to 0.

**Random Feature** adds a feature with random values. It is expected that adding a random feature will maintain the same
impact of the treatment on the target.

These methods are not sufficiently accurate markers of a successful experiment.

## Installation

```bash
pip install hypex
```

## Quick start

Explore usage examples and tutorials [here](https://github.com/sb-ai-lab/Hypex/blob/master/examples/tutorials/).

### Matching example

```python
from hypex import Matcher
from hypex.utils.tutorial_data_creation import create_test_data

# Define your data and parameters
df = create_test_data(rs=42, na_step=45, nan_cols=['age', 'gender'])

info_col = ['user_id']
outcome = 'post_spends'
treatment = 'treat'
model = Matcher(input_data=df, outcome=outcome, treatment=treatment, info_col=info_col)
results, quality_results, df_matched = model.estimate()
```

### AA-test example

```python
from hypex import AATest
from hypex.utils.tutorial_data_creation import create_test_data

data = create_test_data(rs=52, na_step=10, nan_cols=['age', 'gender'])

info_cols = ['user_id', 'signup_month']
target = ['post_spends', 'pre_spends']

experiment = AATest(info_cols=info_cols, target_fields=target)
results = experiment.process(data, iterations=1000)
results.keys()
```

### AB-test example

```python
from hypex import ABTest
from hypex.utils.tutorial_data_creation import create_test_data

data = create_test_data(rs=52, na_step=10, nan_cols=['age', 'gender'])

model = ABTest()
results = model.execute(
    data=data,
    target_field='post_spends',
    target_field_before='pre_spends',
    group_field='group'
)

model.show_beautiful_result()
```
